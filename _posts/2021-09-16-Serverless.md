#### What is serverless?
[Serverless](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless) is a way to not have to worry about the hardware when it comes to scaling, updating and maintaining. There are still servers but they are abstracted away from app development. You **"simply"** package you code in containers for deployment instead. The difference between cloud services and serverless is that the apps is only launched when they are called on. This means that you will only pay for you app whan the code runs.

FaaS or  [Function-as-a-Service](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-faas) is a way of using business logic in Linux containers fully managed by a platform.  You can build a fully worik application with FaaS. What's good about it is that it is increases developers productivity and makes development time shorter. You don't have to make time for server management and it's scaling depends on the use of the service. You write a function in almost any languish.

Serverless and Faas is almoste the same thing but with time, serverless has grown to be more about larger sets of architectural patterns. Serverless can be used for microservies and is not just databases and messaging systems, as it used to be.
