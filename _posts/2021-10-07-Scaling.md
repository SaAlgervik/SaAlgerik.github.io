#### Up vs Out
So the diffrerence is that scaling up, means that you add more machine resources to the server you already have. This could mean that you add a larger hard drive to a computer for increased storage capacity. Maybe you have to replacing the entire computer with a machine that has more CPU and a more performant network interface. If your systam is not in the cloud this will take a long time, weeks or even months. You will hav to buy, install and deploy you system to a whole new hardwear.
While scaling out is that you adds power to your existing machine infastructer like giving it more CPU or RAM to the existing server. If you have a low coupled architecture you can just spin up a new container running a webserver app and adding it to the load balancer pool. 
It becomes alot easier to scale ut by replicating resources. Scaling out also provides greater responsiveness to changes in demand.

#### VM vs App Service
If you have a Virtual Machine(VM) running on Linux, in West Europ and the just one VM with 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, the cost would land around $87.60/month, if you scale it out to three machines the cost would be $256.23/month. If you instead scale it up 8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM the cost would be $341.64/month.

Say instead you have an App Service, still on Linux and in West Europe, the cost of 1 Core, 1.75 GB RAM, 10 GB Storage would land on $13.14/month. Scaling up to 4 Cores, 7 GB RAM, 10 GB Storage would be a total cost of $51.83/month and if you instead scale it out to 1 Core, 1.75 GB RAM, 10 GB Storage and have 3 instances of that machine the cost would land on $39.42/month.

The conclusion of this is that if you have build you application so that you can scale out instaed of up, like with microservices, the cost both with your own servers or with cloud storage, will be lower.

#### Scalable

**DEV/TEST** : So if you use the free one (F1) you can use 1 gb memory and 60 minuts/day, if you upgrade to D1 instead you will 240min/day instead, this will be with shared infatructure and a cost of $82,91. This two don't give you the chance to scale, not manually or automatically Upgrade again to B1 and you will get 100 total Azure Computer Units(ACU), 1.75 gb memory and 10gb disk storage shared by all apps deployed in the App Service plan. You can manually scale up to 3 instances and get 10 daily backups.

**Production:** You start att S1 and you get the same as in B1 but instead of manually scaling you get automatically scaling and up to 10 instances and up to 5 staging slots to use for testing and deployments before swapping them into production. From P1V2-P3V2 you'll get 20 instances , 50 daily backups and up to 20 staging slots to use for testing and deployments before swapping them into production. What differs between them more is P1V2 gives you 210 total ACU and 3.5 GB memory, P2V2 420 total ACU and 7 GB memory and gives you P3V2 840 total ACU, 14 GB memory. 

Next step is P1V3-P3V3 and then you'll get auto scale up to 30 instances instead and 195 minimum ACU/vCPU. At P1V3 you vill have 8 GB memory and 2 vCPU, P2V3 16 GB memory and 4 vCPU and on P3V3 32 GB memory and 8 vCPU.

**Isolated:**  The Isolated service plan is designed to run mission critical workloads, that are required to run in a virtual network. All of them comes with a storage on 1GB and they can scale up to 100 instances with more available upon request. First you have I1-I3 and att I1 you have 1 CORE and 3.50 GB RAM, I2 2 CORES 7GB RAM and on I3 4 CORES and 14GB RAM. And you can onley "pay as you go".

Upgrade to V2 plan and you have it optimized for workloads requiring resource isolation, maximum scalability, and advanced networking features. you can also instead of pay as you go have one and three year Reserved Intsances. Choises you have is I1V2-I3V2 and V1V2 have 2 CORES and 8Gb RAM, I2V2 4 CORES and 16GB RAM and I3V2 8 CORES and 32 GB RAM.
