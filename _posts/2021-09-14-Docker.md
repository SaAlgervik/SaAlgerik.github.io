#### What have we used?
I had all of the things i needed for this to work installs before. The things to get started was VS code and the built in extention for docker, i used the template built in to get started.
I also had Docker Desktop and the windows terminal to build the Docker image. To get all of this over to github i used GitHub Desktop. The only thing i changed was the version that i runs on from '3.4' to '5.0'.

#### Get the container to run

I used the last pipeline as u guid to get started then i followed [this](https://github.com/docker/login-action#github-container-registry) guide to start with. At first we couldn't get the secrets to work as we wanted to so bu using a privat [github token](https://itnext.io/build-ship-github-container-registry-kubernetes-aa06029b3f21#0075) and some changes we got from Stephan we got it to work.

Then we added i secret following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) guide. 

To download it you type in ***"docker login ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME "***. You login with tha name and the GitHub Token as password and then you use ***"docker pull ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME"***.

### Dockerfile

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base    # runtimes and libraries and is optimized for running ASP.NET Core 
                                                      apps in production.
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80   # portnumber

ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build      # Docker imgae with .NET CLI, .NET runtime and ASP.NET Core 
WORKDIR /src         # Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile
COPY ["SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj", "./"]       
RUN dotnet restore "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj"     # Restores the needed nugets for the project
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build  # Runns the project 

FROM build AS publish       #Build compiles the source code into a runnable application.
RUN dotnet publish "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final      # Copying file from previous build
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "SimpleWebHalloWorld.dll"]        # allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable

```
