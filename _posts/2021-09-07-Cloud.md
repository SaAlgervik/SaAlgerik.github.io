The cloud is a whole bunch server connected to each other in a big refrigerator open to anyone wanting to pay for it. Some of it comes for free with you phone and makers it possible to get back your images if you break it. Some other clouds you pay for to store your website, database or the services that you need for your startup idea or for a big company. 
What it really is are tons hardware at the same place, stored and taken care of, by somone else then you or you buisness.

The downside to this is that you don't have 100% control od your data storege set-up. If you lose the connection to the internet you will have no way of getting access to you data and this can come with a big price tag. Security can also be a big factor, depending on tha country the servers are placed in the laws can differ alot. To be the most safe by the law you should have you data center located in Iceland or in Norway. If you just found out about this and got a urge to migrate you cloudservice to a datacenter over there, i got some more bad news, this most likely be **really** difficult...

And whats even more pricey then data retrieval if the system fails, is the cost of the environment, in 2016 the world's data centres use more electricity then the **whole** UK!

Well, lets get to the good stuff! 

If you need to scale thing up due to more visitors to you website and you have all the servers your self, you would have to go an buy a new server so scale up. And maybe two weeks later you go back to the same amount as of users as usual. You will be standing there with some verry expensive hardware you have no use for. 
Say that you instead have this scalable service on the cloud, you can temoorarliy scale up and down as you go. 
If you have users all over the world you can make the experience faster due to that they can connect to the servers that are the closest to them.

Then you have the cost, to build, run and maintain a serverhall is often alot more expensive then renting it from some cloud storage companies. Especially when you only pay for what you need and don't have to pay for employees been sick and so on. 
Something else that is good, is that you can access you data from anywhere in the world. Say that you have a company spread all over the world, as long as you have internet you can all access the same data at all time. 

You can also choose in what grade you want to use the cloud. You can have your whole platform on it with a choosen operating system. You can also just use the tools like Microsoft Office, dopbox or Google photo. I think that almoste everyone in a developed country under has used the cloud in one or an other way.


What we found out about the cost of cloud services is tha the price can differ alot. To get a easy overlook of the prices the simplest sits to get an overlook over is the big ones like Azure. And to see exactly what comes with it. To find other smaller cloud serveces in Europe you don't really get a clear overlook. But if you take the time and write to them about exactly what you need you can get more customised services.
