#### CI pipeline explained
A pipeline i a way of working with development so it's possible to continuously integrate code to running projekt. The way of working makes is possible to integrate new code in under 8 minuts. The way it works looks like this :

It's mostly the blue part of the loop that CI is assosiated to. Depending on the business this is used to diffrent extent and in diffrent ways. 
The CI part of it is Code Commit, Static Code Analysis, Build and Test stages/scenarios. The thing that makes this good is than alot of developers can commit small part of cod many times a day. With this way of working you can see if code fails before it gets hard to fix stuff.

#### Integrate this to my project

I integrated this to my project yestarday by forking an old projekt, adding a .yaml file with some basic scripting looking att [this](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).
At the start we had a .gitignore for a appsettings.json file that broke the pipeline. To fix that we removed the .gitignore and added a appsettings.json. After that we had to make the yaml find where to open the projekt so efter det "dotnet run" we added /source/something.sln **be awere** this is case sensitive. After this steps the action shined green just as we wanted.

```

name: Working Pipeline  # Name of the pipeline
on: [push] # The condition that activates the pipeline 
jobs:
  check-bats-version: # Defines the name of the check-bats-version job stored within the jobs section. 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # The environment the build runs in

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1 Â£ 
        with:
          dotnet-version: 5.0.x
      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore Source/SpacePark.sln # Restores dependencies and packages needed for the solution to run
      - name: Build
        run: dotnet build --no-restore Source/SpacePark.sln # Builds the project
  
```
